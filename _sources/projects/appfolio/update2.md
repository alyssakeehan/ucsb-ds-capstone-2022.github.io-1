# End of Winter Quarter Progress #

## Recap 

We are working with AppFolio, a tech company based in Santa Barbara that provides innovative software, services, and data analytics to the real estate industry. More specifically, we are working with their most popular and successful platform, their Property Management Service.

## About the Project

Our project aims to create a recommendation system that recommends properties to users who interact with the company’s website. Currently, we are working with AppFolio’s Computer Science Capstone team to implement our recommender model into their application that allows users to search rental properties in Santa Barbara county and quickly find information about those properties. As users navigate through the website, they are able to “like” certain properties. These user-item interactions are what we use to recommend properties that users might be interested in.
